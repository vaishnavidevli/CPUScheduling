This is a Java Swing desktop application that simulates CPU scheduling algorithms.  
It allows users to select one of several common scheduling algorithms, specify the number of processes, provide a source file for input data, and run a simulation that demonstrates how processes are scheduled by the CPU.

## Features

- Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Round Robin
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Priority Scheduling
- Simple and user-friendly GUI interface
- Random generation of processes with arrival and burst times
- File input for simulation parameters
- Multithreaded simulation execution for responsive UI and concurrent processing
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## How to Use

1. Run the application by executing the `SchedulingGUI` class.
2. Select the desired scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter the number of processes (0 to 10).
4. Click the **Browse** button to select the input source file.
5. Click **Start** to begin the simulation.
6. The simulation runs on a separate thread to keep the UI responsive and displays results based on the selected algorithm and input.

Feel free to explore and extend this project by adding more algorithms, improving the GUI, or enhancing the simulation visuals.
